Forest Fires - Data Analysis¶
Introduction.
Fires happen when ignition (from a lightning strike or a careless bonfire, for example) meets available fuel (such as dry vegetation), and warm, dry air fans the flames.

That’s why the fire season tends to coincide with high temperatures and dry conditions. In the eastern U.S., fire season lasts from March through May, while the West sees most of its fire activity from June through October.

Fires are an important and necessary part of the lifecycle for many different kinds of ecosystems. For as long as forests and grasslands have grown on earth, fires have burned them. In fact, some tree species, like lodgepole pines and aspens, need fire to stimulate their growth.

Fires have also been used by people as a way to manage lands, whether to clear land for farming, get rid of unwanted pests, or to restore nutrients to the soil.
